# CA in Practice

## Overview

**CA in Practice** is an educational project aimed at replicating and understanding the concepts of **Correspondence Analysis (CA)** as described in Michael Greenacre's book *"La práctica del análisis de correspondencias"* (Ediciones BBVA, 2008). The goal of this project is to provide a hands-on implementation of the exercises presented in the book, ensuring that users can learn and explore the methods of correspondence analysis in an accessible way.

This project is developed strictly for educational purposes, focusing on understanding and reproducing the original examples from Greenacre's book without applying them to other real-world domains, such as finance or investments.

## Purpose

The main purpose of this repository is:
- To replicate exercises and concepts from *"La práctica del análisis de correspondencias"* by Michael Greenacre.
- To verify and validate the outcomes of these exercises by comparing them with those presented in the book.
- To provide a comprehensive educational resource for those learning about correspondence analysis, by offering a detailed implementation of the book’s concepts.

The project is designed purely for educational purposes and aims to help those interested in learning correspondence analysis by working through the theoretical examples provided by Michael Greenacre.

## Attribution
